# 📊 Scenario Analysis

## Scenario 1: Chatbot on Edge Device (LLaMA 7B, 100 tokens, CPU)
- **Latency**: 29.4 ms
- **Memory**: 15.5 GB
- **Cost**: $0.029
- ❌ Not ideal: High latency and CPU barely fits model.

## Scenario 2: Cloud Inference (13B, 256 tokens, A100)
- **Latency**: 30.5 ms
- **Memory**: 27 GB
- **Cost**: $0.036
- ✅ Ideal: Fast, efficient, affordable with A100.

## Scenario 3: API Backend (GPT-4, 512 tokens, OpenAI)
- ⚠️ Model details abstracted.
- Latency ~2-4s per request.
- Cost: $0.06 to $0.12 depending on token size.
- ✅ Good for high-quality tasks, but expensive.

## 🔁 Recommendation Summary

- For low-latency apps → LLaMA 7B + A100/TPU
- For cost-sensitive APIs → GPT-3.5 or quantized 7B local
- For complex reasoning → GPT-4 (accept tradeoff in cost/latency)
